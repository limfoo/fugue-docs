> Code is the machine phase; documentation is the semantic phase. The two phases must stay isomorphic — any change in one phase that is not reflected in the other means the task is incomplete.

A toolkit that turns the *GEB Fractal Documentation Protocol* into an everyday way of working with AI: a three-level fractal index (L1 project / L2 folder / L3 file header) plus a mandatory update loop and machine-verifiable isomorphism — built to fight project entropy in the age of AI-assisted coding, where code grows messy and docs always lag behind.

Claude Code and Codex both support automatic maintenance through native hooks; Codex also supports a standalone skill and project rules. The same protocol works with Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Copilot and web chat. See [Works with any tool, any model](#works-with-any-tool-any-model) for each integration and optional commit checks.

## Native Codex hooks: automatic maintenance, model-written semantics

`geb_install_codex.py --hooks` installs nine events: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Pre/PostToolUse, Stop, SessionEnd, Interrupt and SubagentStart/SubagentStop. Once enabled and trusted through Codex's native review, routine development needs no manual sync, check or metering commands. Session start provides navigation, tool events track this session's changes, and Stop adds L3 headers, syncs machine fields and returns new semantic gaps to the model to finish. Subagents receive the same maintenance through their own lifecycle events, with metering bound independently to their logs. Unchanged gaps are raised once. Projects without the protocol are not initialized automatically.

The current interface was checked against Codex CLI `0.159.0-alpha.3`, where `hooks` is stable and enabled by default; the obsolete `plugin_hooks` flag is unnecessary. Hooks run on the Codex host and cannot maintain remote files that host cannot access. Desktop and cloud support require separate verification. See [Install](#install) and the [hook reference](references/codex-hooks.md) for events, attribution boundaries and source references.

## v2.7: Claude Code hooks, model only for semantics

The first three-arm pilot showed the full Fugue workflow costing 44%–82% more uncached input plus output than indexes alone on small changes, mostly because the model re-read skill docs and ran the metering, sync and check scripts itself. v2.7 hands that work to programs:

- **Only files the model wrote**: before the model uses an edit or write tool, a hook records the target file; around each shell command it compares uncommitted changes, so the files that command changed are recorded. Files brought in by git commands such as checkout, pull, merge or stash pop, files you edit yourself, and files written by another session in the same repository are not attributed. Files that are committed, reverted, or edited again by you between turns drop out. Session start adds only a one-line navigation hint to context.
- **End of each turn**: only code files the session wrote, that still differ and are uncommitted, are handled. Nothing is written during a merge or rebase; files with conflicts or syntax errors, non-UTF-8 files, generated code and symlinks leaving the project are skipped one by one, keeping their existing machine fields in the ledgers. New files get an L3 header skeleton; dependencies and ledgers are synced incrementally by `geb_sync`; body-only edits are silent. Only semantic gaps (a new file's `[POS]`, a ledger duty, `[OUTPUT]` after an export change, a new directory's role) reach the model as one short prompt, and the same gap is raised once while its content is unchanged.
- **Metering**: actual usage is summed from the Claude Code transcript, de-duplicated by message, into `~/.claude/fugue/metrics` in the Codex-compatible ledger format. The transcript format is not a public interface; unreadable usage stays unknown, never zero.
- **SKILL.md** body is about 40% smaller. With hooks installed, routine coding no longer needs the skill; workflows without enabled hooks use [references/manual-workflow.md](references/manual-workflow.md).

Installing through the plugin marketplace enables the hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`); projects without indexes are untouched. If you registered `geb_stop_hook.py` in `settings.json` by hand, remove that entry so two Stop hooks do not run. No real-model comparison has been run for this release yet; savings still need to be measured.

## v2.5: Task Receipts and Measurement Diagnostics

Task receipts show observed tokens, wall-clock intervals, validation outcomes and comparison status. New diagnostics resolve paginated Codex logs through a read-only index and expose measurement coverage. Missing telemetry is not zero; without a reviewed baseline, savings remain unknown. See [accounting](references/token-accounting.md) and the [bounded pilot](evals/token-pilot.md).

The [first three-arm pilot](evals/TOKEN_PILOT_RESULTS.md) stopped at the soft budget after six calls across two task blocks; five passed acceptance. In the two eligible workflow pairs, Fugue used 44.2% and 82.0% more uncached input plus output than indexes alone. This limited self-hosted sample does not establish general savings or costs.

## v2.4: Codex and Measured Usage

Requires Python 3.9+. `geb_arch.py` generates architecture candidates from shared dependency facts, with file-level evidence and unresolved imports. Scores are heuristics, not calibrated probabilities. Sync preserves non-code ledger rows and handles empty directories and Unicode Git paths. Commit hooks validate the staged snapshot.

See [Install](#install) below and the [Codex guide](references/codex.md) for current setup. Project skills use `.agents/skills/fugue-docs`; personal skills use `~/.agents/skills/fugue-docs`. The default installs only the skill; explicit `--hooks` also registers native Codex hooks.

Without hooks, `scripts/geb_metrics.py` optionally records task token intervals when requested, with readable local telemetry and a writable ledger. Enabled hooks record available telemetry automatically. The default ledger is `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/fugue/metrics/`; missing telemetry stays unknown and does not block development. Savings stay unknown without an independent, quality-reviewed comparison on the same task, model and revision. Negative differences remain negative. See [accounting details](references/token-accounting.md) and [tests](evals/README.md). CI runs boundary tests and self-checks on macOS/Linux with Python 3.9/3.14.

## Origin & Credits

The protocol's founding ideas come from **Zhao Chunxiang (chunxiang)**'s "GEB Fractal Documentation System Protocol" (the L1/L2/L3 index, self-referencing updates, the loop), inspired by Douglas Hofstadter's *Gödel, Escher, Bach*. The original official implementation (CLI + Claude Code plugin + VSCode extension) lives at [Claudate/project-multilevel-index](https://github.com/Claudate/project-multilevel-index) (MIT).

fugue-docs is an **independent implementation and an independent evolution**: it uses no code from the original repository, written from scratch as a skill (methodology injection) rather than a plugin/CLI; the protocol-invariant abstraction, machine-field views (geb_sync), recursive fractal, scale-elastic profiles, and the machine facts source are original to this repository (the full evolution is in the commit history). The name "fugue" honors Polyphony — one of the protocol's three core properties: code, indexes, and docs answer each other like voices in a fugue, keeping the project self-maintaining.

## Capabilities

### How it works (applies automatically, no commands)

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Entering an unfamiliar project | Reverse loop: read L1 → L2 → L3 before reading code |
| Project has no doc structure | Scaffold a skeleton + fill in semantics bottom-up (actually read the code; no fabrication) |
| Any code added / changed / deleted | Forward loop: L3 file header → L2 folder index → L1 project index; not "done" until docs are updated |
| Docs suspected stale | Run `geb_check.py` for a violation report |

### Six design principles

1. **Isomorphism is verifiable, not a slogan**: `geb_check.py` checks in two layers — **structural** (default): L1 existence, L2 coverage, L3 tag completeness, ledger reconciliation (missing + ghost entries); **semantic drift** (`--strict`, conservative heuristics): does L1 mention every top-level code directory, does each L3 `[INPUT]` keep up with actual imports. Non-zero exit = phases out of sync; CI-ready. Deeper semantic sync is the AI loop's job — an explicit division of labor, not a gap. A CLAUDE.md only counts as an index when it carries GEB protocol markers, closing the "prose CLAUDE.md adopts the protocol in name only" loophole. This repo checks itself with `--strict` in CI.
2. **The loop is a hard constraint, not model goodwill**: three gates, enable as needed — Claude Code / Codex Stop hook (before finishing), git pre-commit hook (before committing), CI (before merging). See "Hard-constraint mode" below.
3. **The machine phase is fully automated; only the semantic phase needs intelligence**: at initialization the scaffolder generates the skeleton statically (semantics left as `TODO`); during maintenance `geb_sync` treats `[INPUT]` lines and ledger tables as **views regenerated from code** — derived data is never hand-copied or reconciled, reducing machine-field drift within the parser's tested coverage. The machine never pretends to understand semantics.
4. **Layer count scales with complexity — it is not dogma**: the protocol's invariants are "every semantic boundary has a locatable index, indexes declare coverage, entities backlink, machines verify, costs stay proportional"; L1/L2/L3 is just the default profile — small projects (≤20 files) automatically drop to two layers (ledger folded into L1), and the **recursive fractal** extends upward: a subdirectory with its own `PROJECT_INDEX.md` is a subproject (its L1 doubles as the parent's L2) with automatic recursive checking and syncing — native monorepo support. No headers for generated files / configs / vendored deps.
5. **Bottom-up initialization**: L3 comes from reading code, L2 summarizes L3, L1 summarizes L2 — every level grounded in facts. Fabricated docs are worse than no docs.
6. **Transparent and auditable**: every task ends with a loop report line `GEB loop: L3 ✓ | L2 ✓ | L1 —`; when sandboxes forbid script execution, fall back to manual reconciliation following the checker's logic, stated honestly.

## Install

### Codex

Run from this repository, replacing the path with your project:

```bash
python3 scripts/geb_install_codex.py --project /path/to/project --hooks --dry-run
python3 scripts/geb_install_codex.py --project /path/to/project --hooks
```

The project skill goes in `.agents/skills/fugue-docs`; `--hooks` writes native configuration to the project's `.codex/hooks.json`. Use `--user --hooks` for personal installation, with hooks at `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/hooks.json`. A custom `--dest /path/to/skills/fugue-docs --hooks` also requires `--hooks-dir <configuration-directory>`. Project and personal hooks accumulate: register Fugue at only one scope for a given project. Linked worktrees require explicit `--hooks-dir` selecting the actual configuration source.

Reopen the project or start a new session, confirm the skill appears, and review and trust the commands through Codex's **Hooks need review** or `/hooks`. The installer does not prefill trust, set bypass flags or change `config.toml`. For first adoption, request `$fugue-docs Initialize indexes for this project`; installation itself does not initialize indexes. With indexes present and trusted hooks active, maintenance runs automatically and the model only responds to semantic prompts. Continue running relevant project tests.

Omit `--hooks` to keep the default skill-only installation and use [manual sync and checks](references/manual-workflow.md). Manual `--changed` includes all uncommitted repository changes: preview its scope and preserve others' edits. Native hook metering keeps missing or mismatched telemetry unknown, without repeated `doctor` calls, elevated access or blocking development. `FUGUE_DATA_DIR` overrides the hook data directory.

Add `--update` for updates and preview with `--dry-run`. The installer preserves other hooks and rejects locally modified managed files or entries. It copies only allowlisted skill files, excludes Claude's `.claude-plugin/` and `hooks/`, and does not register pre-commit or CI. See the [Codex guide](references/codex.md) for complete commands and environment limits.

Without a native skill, run `python3 scripts/geb_adapt.py /path/to/project --tool codex --copy-tools --lang en`, first adding `--dry-run`. This injects rules into an existing `AGENTS.override.md`, otherwise `AGENTS.md`, and copies scripts into the project. See [references/codex.md](references/codex.md) for details.

### Claude Code

Option 1 — plugin marketplace (recommended, two commands inside Claude Code):

```
/plugin marketplace add AaronXinzhian/fugue-docs
/plugin install fugue-docs@fugue-docs
```

Option 2 — manual install as a personal skill:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AaronXinzhian/fugue-docs.git
cp -r fugue-docs ~/.claude/skills/fugue-docs
```

## Usage

The `/fugue-docs` invocation below applies to Claude Code. Codex uses `$fugue-docs` for explicit requests; enabled and trusted native hooks handle routine maintenance automatically, with a manual workflow available otherwise:

- **Automatic**: whenever Claude creates / modifies / deletes / renames code in any project, the protocol applies automatically. Requests like "initialize docs", "map out this project", or "the docs are out of sync" also trigger it.
- **Manual `/fugue-docs`**: not a built-in command — Claude Code auto-generates a slash command for every installed skill. Type `/fugue-docs` plus your request to invoke the protocol explicitly, e.g. `/fugue-docs index this project`.
- **CLI tools** (AI-independent, usable standalone):

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `python3 scripts/geb_sync.py <project>` | Machine-field sync: `[INPUT]` lines & ledger tables regenerated from code (semantic columns preserved); `--graph` redraws the dependency graph |
| `python3 scripts/geb_check.py <project>` | Structural check; `--strict` drift audit, `--complete` TODO sweep, `--report` loop line, `--emit-facts` machine facts JSON, `--json` for CI |
| `python3 scripts/geb_scaffold.py <project>` | Deterministic scaffolder; `--dry-run` to preview |
| `python3 scripts/geb_adapt.py <project> --tool …` | Plug the protocol into other AI tools (next section) |
| `python3 scripts/geb_install_codex.py --project <project> --hooks` | Install the Codex skill and native hooks; `--user` for personal scope, `--dry-run` to preview, `--update` to update |

## Works with any tool, any model

The protocol is decoupled from the tooling: [adapters/PROTOCOL_EN.md](adapters/PROTOCOL_EN.md) is the **portable core** (single source of truth, Chinese & English), and `geb_adapt.py` injects it into any tool's rule file with one command — optionally installing the hard constraints at the same time:

```bash
python3 scripts/geb_adapt.py /path/to/project --tool cursor codex --pre-commit --lang en
python3 scripts/geb_adapt.py /path/to/project --tool all --ci --lang en
```

It modifies the target project's rule files, `.git/hooks/`, and `.github/workflows/` — it prints the list of write targets before acting; add `--dry-run` to preview without changing anything.

| Tool / model | Integration | Command |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Claude Code | skill, auto-triggered (best experience) | `/plugin install fugue-docs@fugue-docs` |
| OpenAI Codex | Native skill or project `AGENTS.override.md` / `AGENTS.md` | `geb_install_codex.py --project …` or `--tool codex --copy-tools` |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` | `--tool cursor` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` | `--tool windsurf` |
| Cline / Roo Code (DeepSeek or any model) | `.clinerules` | `--tool cline` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | `--tool copilot` |
| Any chat model (Grok / DeepSeek web, …) | paste `GEB_PROTOCOL.md` as system prompt | `--tool generic` |
| Any git repo (AI-independent) | pre-commit rejects out-of-sync commits | `--pre-commit` |
| Any CI | GitHub Actions check workflow | `--ci` |

Injection is **idempotent**: the protocol lives between `GEB-PROTOCOL BEGIN/END` markers, re-runs update in place, and the rest of your rule file is never touched. The `--pre-commit` hook is self-contained (the checker is copied alongside), with no dependency on this repository. For low-context models or tools with rule-size limits, add `--compact` to inject a ~300-word edition of the protocol.

**Why can non-Claude models get close to the same results?** Because the protocol systematically moves the demand for "model discipline" into deterministic tooling: the scaffolder emits an explicit `TODO` worklist, the checker emits an itemized violation list, and pre-commit/CI turn that list into feedback that cannot be ignored. All a model needs is the ability to read an error message and fix accordingly — table stakes for every modern model. Stronger models produce richer semantics, but **structural rules are checked by deterministic tools within their documented coverage**.

### Deterministic scaffolder (fast initialization for large projects)

```bash
python3 scripts/geb_scaffold.py /path/to/project           # generate skeleton (idempotent; never overwrites)
python3 scripts/geb_scaffold.py /path/to/project --dry-run # preview only
```

`[INPUT]` comes from import analysis, `[OUTPUT]` from export analysis (AST for Python, pattern matching for the rest — C/C++/C#/Ruby/PHP/Swift/Shell/Scala/Lua/Objective-C and more; recognized code extensions use language-specific best-effort analyzers); the directory tree and a draft Mermaid dependency graph are generated alongside. Semantic spots — `[POS]`, module roles — are left as `TODO` placeholders. Initializing a large project drops from "deep-read every file" to "fill in the semantics": less manual fact transcription; net token savings still require controlled measurements.

### Hard-constraint mode (optional, recommended)

**Claude Code users**: the plugin enables the hooks automatically. In projects with a root `PROJECT_INDEX.md` (protocol adopted), each turn ends with machine fields synced and only this session's semantic gaps fed back to the model; projects without the protocol are untouched. If you installed the skill by hand, add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "timeout": 30,
      "command": "python3 \"$HOME/.claude/skills/fugue-docs/scripts/geb_hook.py\" session-start"}]}],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "timeout": 30,
      "command": "python3 \"$HOME/.claude/skills/fugue-docs/scripts/geb_hook.py\" prompt"}]}],
    "PreToolUse": [{"matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Bash", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "timeout": 30,
      "command": "python3 \"$HOME/.claude/skills/fugue-docs/scripts/geb_hook.py\" pre-tool"}]}],
    "PostToolUse": [{"matcher": "Bash", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "timeout": 30,
      "command": "python3 \"$HOME/.claude/skills/fugue-docs/scripts/geb_hook.py\" post-tool"}]}],
    "Stop": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "timeout": 60,
      "command": "python3 \"$HOME/.claude/skills/fugue-docs/scripts/geb_hook.py\" stop"}]}],
    "SessionEnd": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "timeout": 30,
      "command": "python3 \"$HOME/.claude/skills/fugue-docs/scripts/geb_hook.py\" session-end"}]}]
  }
}
```

The hook only handles files changed in this session and still uncommitted, so pre-existing drift never blocks the model; leave that to pre-commit and CI. When a project crosses the small-project limit, duties written in the L1 move into newly created FOLDER_INDEX.md files instead of being dropped. Set `FUGUE_HOOK_QUIET=1` to drop the session-start hint. The older `geb_stop_hook.py` is still shipped: it checks the whole project and blocks on any violation, for the strictest setup. Do not register it together with `geb_hook.py stop`.

**Users of other tools**: see [Works with any tool, any model](#works-with-any-tool-any-model) above — `geb_adapt.py --pre-commit` installs the same commit gate with one command (self-contained, no dependency on this repo). Out-of-sync commits are rejected, no matter who (human or which AI) wrote the code.

**Team adoption path** (light to heavy — don't jump straight to the end): ① `geb_adapt.py --dry-run` to see what would change; ② pilot pre-commit on one repo for a week or two; ③ promote to CI as the team gate if it earns its keep; ④ the global skill is a personal opt-in for heavy users. Enforcement strength should follow trust, not precede it.

## Benchmarks

Method: 3 realistic scenarios × with/without the skill, each side executed by an independent Claude Code subagent (unaware of the other), all 16 assertions graded by scripts rather than human impressions. The complete eval package (cases + project fixtures + automated grader) ships in [evals/](evals/README.md) with rerun instructions. Honest caveat: the table below reports a **single run per scenario (n=1)** — treat absolute time/token numbers as indicative; assertion pass rates are the primary metric. Reruns welcome.

| Scenario | With skill | Baseline | Time (with / without) | Tokens (with / without) |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Initialize docs for a legacy project | **5/5** | 4/5 | **222s** / 367s | 37.9k / 35.7k |
| Maintain the loop after adding a feature | **5/5** | 5/5 | 140s / 139s | 24.4k / 21.8k |
| Clean up ghost references after a refactor | **6/6** | 6/6 | 127s / 110s | 24.9k / 21.0k |

The table records one run per scenario. Initialization took 222s versus 367s in that run; this does not establish a general 40% speedup. All three skill runs used more tokens than their baselines. Benefits of the newer programmatic pipeline require separate controlled measurements.

The published v2.3 result of 30/30 represents six deterministic groups repeated five times, not 30 independent scenarios. It tests repeatability within that coverage, not semantic quality or token savings. The comprehension grader uses keyword proxies and requires separate quality review; missing token counts remain unknown.

## Project status & boundaries of applicability

Plainly: this is a young project (released June 2026). Judge fitness by these boundaries.

**Good fit**: solo or small-team projects where AI does most of the coding; inheriting an undocumented legacy codebase (scaffold the skeleton, let AI fill semantics); long-lived projects where every new AI session or new teammate should understand the structure on arrival.

**Use with caution / not yet**: teams that barely use AI — the loop's maintenance cost only pays off when AI carries it, by hand it becomes a burden; very large monorepos — recursive fractal support just landed and lacks battle-testing on real big repos; and don't treat it as a universal documentation solution — it governs **structure and dependency sync**; tutorials, API references, and design docs are out of scope.

**Verification status, stated honestly**: small-scale script-graded controlled runs (n=1 per scenario, replayable) + this repo's own dogfooding (CI self-checks with --strict on every push) + multiple rounds of external model reviews (every finding and its resolution is in the commit history); **no long-term production data from teams yet**. Comprehension tests and real-repo case studies are accumulating. Found a problem? Open an issue — digesting criticism is literally how this project iterates.
